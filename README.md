Title: Surprisingly useful but very corny
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2018
Review: I found rating this book quite difficult. I was excited to read it because I really liked the original article it was based on. The first part of the book was unfortunately much cornier than I expected, which has caused me to be more cynical in my opinion of it than I would otherwise be.

I begrudgingly have to admit that, despite this, the book was actually helpful. The thoughts it brought to my mind surprised me, and I can honestly say I have a better idea now of what I could do as a job versus what my calling is. And it was difficult to admit what that calling is, so I'm grateful to this book for the help.

I bought the book during a sale for less than 2 dollars, and its small size combined with its corniness would definitely make me regret the purchase if I had gotten it for full price. If you do find it on sale, however, and are willing to ignore some cringe-worthy expressions, you might find some surprisingly helpful advice here.

Title: Light Inspirational Reading, But Don't Expect Too Much Beyond That
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2018
Review: The good, the bad, and the ugly. The good. If you are looking for a simple, short, uplifting book full of quotes that you have probably heard before, but some decent ideas about life and another way to live it that maybe you haven't considered, then this might be a good book for you. I think the average person looking for a quick pick-me-up could get something out of this book. "Quick pick me up" because it's short, and half of it is whole pages of large quotes from other people. So think, cute inspiring coffee table book or lunch break reading.

The bad. The book is really short, has a lot of sort of cheap filler quotations that aren't even that original. So while it can be inspirational, it's not really worth $10 bucks if you are looking for something longer with more depth. In this case, I'd go for Julia Cameron's "The Artist Way." Same ideas, but better writing (beautiful writing) and an entire 12 week program of embracing your Musts, whatever that may mean to you. Seriously, it's a good book, life changing. And I don't think it's much more than this book.

The ugly. The author's premise is that life offers you two choice, Must and Should. Must is what we are inspired to do, it's almost as if the Universe is constantly nudging us toward it. The Should is what we do because others expect it of us or because it makes sense practically. As, I read this book, it really didn't seem likely that writing it was "A Must" for the author. It reads like a practical opportunity to make some extra money from an article she wrote that was perhaps truly inspiring. It doesn't even feel like she put much effort or enthusiasm into it. The original article may have been a "Must," but the book definitely reads like a "Should."

Title: I‚Äôve gifted this several times. Love it!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021
Review: I received this book as a gift a few years ago and have purchased several more as gifts. Love it so much!! It‚Äôs a FUN self-help book, not a sad one like the rest. This is energizing and visually really pretty. I bought this particular one for a college freshman who is majoring in social work. It‚Äôs perfect!

Title: Eye-Opening Read
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021
Review: I bought this book two years ago and it sat in my bookshelf until recently. I read it quickly but I learned quite a bit. I will be going back to this book to remind myself of all the wisdom in it.

Title: every page is amazing..
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2018
Review: I haven't gotten through the whole book, but omg, every page is amazing... so intriguing and inspiring! And FUN to read! Even the printing and style is so interesting - her wise words jump off the page! I don't think I've ever seen a book like this. I'd love to chat with this author! Her perspective is just amazing!

Title: Great Gift for the girlfriends!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2016
Review: Love this book! Seems like everyone is or has been in a place where you feel a little lost and find yourself sad you might not be doing something you are passionate about. Regardless if you take Elle's advice, it's a great and quick read for a little kick in the butt on passions in life. Bought one for all my girlfriends for Christmas/ New Years presents!

Title: If you have always done it their way, it is time to read this book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2018
Review: What a great find. I read this book in a week. It gave me the direction that I needed before my life was over and I had regrets. I mean this with all my heart. It was life changing thoughts for me.

Title: good read
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2017
Review: This is one of my favorite books. The premise of the book wasn't life changing for me, but sometimes we need to be reminded to "follow our must" It is simple and a short read. You can get the gist of the book by reading the author's medium post that inspired the book, but I still recommend purchasing the book.
